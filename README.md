# Backpropagation Regression Using Keras

This notebook demonstrates how **backpropagation is applied to a regression problem** using a neural network built with **Keras**.

It focuses on understanding how modern deep learning frameworks abstract the training process while still relying on core backpropagation principles.

---

## Concepts Covered
- Neural network architecture for regression
- Forward propagation using Keras layers
- Loss computation and optimization
- Backpropagation handled internally by Keras
- Model training and prediction

---

## Learning Objective
The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between:
- **Backpropagation from scratch**
- **Framework-based deep learning workflows**

This helps in transitioning from theory-heavy implementations to real-world deep learning practices.

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (if used)

## Project Purpose
This notebook is part of my **Deep Learning learning journey**, focusing on building a strong foundation in neural networks and understanding how industry-standard frameworks train models efficiently.
